# BACKLOG — Open issues (as of 2026-07-08, from Will's live TESTHUB play session)

> This is the authoritative running list of everything still broken or unfinished.
> Ordered roughly by priority. Each item: symptom (what Will saw) → likely cause →

## 🔴 P0 — visible/blocking, confirmed in-game 2026-07-08

### B-PORTAL-1: Portals are ugly flat blue panels / hard-to-see arrows
- **Symptom (Will, screenshots):** the born-open GridEntrance portals now APPEAR (build27 fix
  worked) but render as a **flat 2D blue rectangle** with a small light-blue triangle/arrow, not
  an attractive portal. In Duister (Secret Place) they're flat teal panels floating in the room.
- **Cause:** when we swapped GridEntranceDynamic → base GridEntrance for the born-open fix
  (commit portals-born-open / build27), we kept `mesh` but the base GridEntrance class renders its
  portal-plane placeholder (the blue panel) rather than a nice swirling FX. The dynamic class had
  the pretty visual tied to its open-animation; the static class shows the raw portal quad.
- **Fix approach:** give the portal records a proper portal MESH + FX. Options: (a) find a
  base-game always-open portal that looks good and copy its mesh/fx fields; (b) attach a portal
  particle effect (the Tower-of-Judgment `TJ_JudgementRoom_PortalObject` swirl, or a rift FX) as a
  separate decoration/effect entity co-located with each portal; (c) check if base GridEntrance has
  a `portalFxName`/`meshFxName` field that we left empty. MUST keep born-open + teleport working
  (don't revert to Dynamic). Files: tools/apply_svc_patches.py (the `_make_portals_born_open_*`
  block) for record fields, or tools/build_section_surgery.py to co-locate an FX entity.
- **Verify:** in-game only (visual). Static gate: portal record has a non-empty mesh/fx that resolves.

### B-PORTAL-2: Portal placed in the middle of the walkway (blocks passage)
- **Symptom:** the blue portal to the RHS of the respawn fountain sits **right in the path** —
  Will can't walk past it without being teleported. (Screenshot 1: the flat blue panel east of the
  fountain, on the only route.)
- **Cause:** hub/door portal placement coords chosen for on-mesh + distance-from-friendlies, but
  NOT for "off the natural walking path." A portal you can't avoid = forced teleport.
- **Fix approach:** relocate that portal (and audit all hub portals) OFF the main traffic lane —
  tuck them against a wall/edge so the player walks TO them deliberately. In the blood-cave first
  room the 5 hub portals should be a neat row along a wall, not blocking the tunnel. Files:
  `_HUB_CAVE_ENTRANCES` / `_HUB_CAVE_RETURNS` coords in tools/build_section_surgery.py; the door
  portal coords in the A1/A2/Sparta specs. Re-run gate_doors_hub after moving.
- **NOTE:** this is the TESTHUB hub portals AND possibly canonical doors — check both.

### B-PORTAL-3: Return/back teleport doesn't work (one-way trip)
- **Symptom:** Will teleported to "Duister" (Secret Place) via the panel, could walk around, but
  **could not teleport back**. Also: "all the portals in Duister are broken."
- **Cause:** the return portal (GridExitOneWay landing → its own back-entrance) either wasn't
  swapped to born-open (only the OUTBOUND portal_olympianarena1 was swapped; the RETURN
  portal_olympianarena2 is GridExitOneWay — is IT visible/functional?), OR the Secret Place cluster's
  INTERNAL portals (SV's own darkforest transition portals) are DynGridEntrance that never open
  (same class bug, different records, explicitly out-of-scope in the born-open fix — see
  DYNGRID_GATE_RCA.md note 2). "All portals in Duister broken" strongly implies the 11-level Secret
  Place cluster's own inter-level portals need the same born-open treatment.
- **Fix approach:** (1) verify the return portal_olympianarena2 renders + teleports (GridExitOneWay
  semantics — does it need born-open too? it's a different class); (2) enumerate ALL DynGridEntrance
  portals in the Secret Place cluster (and every SV area) and apply the born-open swap to them too
  (generalize `_make_portals_born_open` beyond portal_olympianarena1 to ALL our-relevant
  DynGridEntrance records that should be always-open). Files: apply_svc_patches born-open block.

### B-SUMMON-1: Summoned pets spawn NAKED / broken (no equipment, some immobile)
- **Symptom (Will):** "Summon Boneash" summons Boneash but he has **no weapon, no helmet, no
  chestplate, no greaves — nothing**. Earlier: the Blood-High-Priest soul's "Call the Blood
  Blade-Dancer" summon appeared as a **floating scythe, immobile** (bug F).
- **Cause:** the wave-created pets (and possibly the base Boneash) have incomplete equipment/visual
  wiring. Per CLAUDE.md lessons: pet equipment must be set via `_set_pet_equipment()` with hardcoded
  item paths — copying loot/equip fields from Monster.tpl → Pet.tpl CRASHES, so pets are authored
  bare and equipment is added back explicitly. If `_set_pet_equipment` wasn't called (or the item
  paths are wrong), the pet spawns naked. The floating-scythe = mesh/animation-table mismatch
  (the pet's mesh is a weapon-only rig, or charAnimationTable doesn't match the body mesh).
- **Fix approach:** THIS IS THE ENTITY CONTRACT SUITE'S JOB (spec in HANDOFF §4b, workflow
  wf_87586bbf-b63 was STOPPED on hold — RESUME it). It must: (1) for every summonable pet, verify
  mesh + charAnimationTable exist and are rig-compatible; (2) verify equipment is wired
  (`_set_pet_equipment` called with resolving paths) OR the pet is intentionally unarmed; (3) fail
  the build on any naked/floating/immobile pet. First fix Boneash + Blade-Dancer, then all wave pets.
  Files: tools/apply_svc_patches.py pet-creation blocks; reference the WORKING Lyia Leafsong pet.
- **Cross-check:** Will said "if this soul has this issue we probably have many others" — treat as
  systemic across ALL summon souls we created (bwpriest x3, lillued x3, and any other spawnObjects).

### B-TOXEUS-1: Blood Toxeus shroud is still GREEN, not RED
- **Symptom (Will, screenshot 2):** the new Toxeus the Murderer, Devourer of Blood boss fights, but
  the **aura/shroud around him is GREEN** (the Athens-Toxeus poison shroud), not red.
- **Cause:** the rename+reskin (toxeus-devourer-rename) changed the MESH to the Athens rig +
  the crimson skin TEXTURE, but the SHROUD is a separate attached FX/skill (the Athens Toxeus has a
  green poison-cloud aura skill or a bound FX). We changed body color but not the aura FX color.
- **Fix approach:** find the aura/shroud FX on um_bloodtoxeus_99 (a skill in its skill list, or a
  charFX/bound-effect field) — it's inherited from the Athens Toxeus (green poison theme). Swap it
  to a red/blood-themed FX (there are red/blood FX in the DRX effects — trail_wep_spear uses blood;
  look for a red aura/cloud). Files: apply_svc_patches _create_blood_toxeus, the monster's FX/skill
  fields. Keep his Blood Boil kit; just recolor the ambient shroud.

## 🟠 P1 — confirmed broken, non-blocking

### B-SPRITE-1: Exploding sprites do not respawn (STILL — reconfirmed 2026-07-08)
- **Symptom:** the exploding sprites near the occultist pyre spawn once, then never again — Will
  stood on the volcano/pyre spawner for minutes, nothing new. (Was task #37A; STILL broken.)
- **Cause (hypothesis):** our placed t1_pitspawner cluster is missing the continuous-spawn config
  (spawn interval / max-alive / respawn-on-death fields) OR is a one-shot-per-level-load spawner
  vs the Greece exemplar's continuous one. Will's leave-and-return discriminator test was never
  reported back — needs it: leave the area + return; if 3 fresh sprites reappear = per-level-load
  refill (config gap); if none = spawner died with its brood (wrong record).
- **Fix approach:** diff our pit records vs the LIVE Greece occultist pit (which spawns
  continuously) field-by-field — spawn timing/limit/controller. Match Greece. Files:
  tools/build_section_surgery.py sprite/pit specs (the B2 block).

### B-TEMPLE-DOOR-1: "Temple Entrance - Locked ~ Sealed By Guardian" won't open
- **Symptom:** killing the guardian in front of the sealed temple door in the blood cave does NOT
  unseal it. (Was task #37C.)
- **Cause candidates:** (1) the controlling quest was NEVER PORTED — the "4 questlines = complete"
  conclusion may be wrong; re-audit the ~86 upstream .qst files for a temple-door/guardian
  controller; (2) the quest's Condition_MonsterDeath watches a DIFFERENT monster record than the
  one Will killed (check our monster renames/soul-wave didn't change the guardian's record name);
  (3) the door's UnlockFixedItem binding broke in the merge.
- **Fix approach:** trace SV's unlock chain end-to-end; port/restore the controller quest; add to
  the map contract suite (a sealed door must have a live unlock path). Files: tools/build_quest_files.py.

### B-SMOKE-1: Region smoke density far below SV (STILL — reconfirmed)
- **Symptom:** some smoke present, but SV had FAR more, starting the moment you enter the section.
- **Cause:** the C4 atmosphere restore covered ENTITY emitters only; the REGION-WIDE ENVIRONMENT
  half (SD/0x18 or level 0x09 env params — volumetric fog) was never restored (vet hedge on record).
- **Fix approach:** deep-parse SV's SD/0x09 env records for the HV01 region + the Delphi occultist
  region; diff vs shipped; restore the region-wide fog params SV-faithfully. Files: map tooling
  (svaera_plus_portals / build_section_surgery — needs an SD or 0x09 patch path that may not exist
  yet = new capability).

## 🟡 P2 — pending answers / smaller

### B-CHEST-1: Esfri's chest formula outcome UNANSWERED
- Will opened the hidden blood-cave supra chest; did a supra FORMULA (Paragon of Violence etc.)
  actually drop into his bag? Static chain verified (docs/UBER_WEAPONS_AUDIT.md). Ask Will.

### B-DUISTER-EXPLORE: Secret Place ("Duister") first-visit findings incomplete
- Will reached Duister but died to Toxeus before touring the other areas. All 5 hub destinations
  (Knossos/Uber, Garden, Sparta, Secret Place, Murder Bunny) still need a full walk-test once the
  portals are pretty + return works. Duister's own portals all reported broken (see B-PORTAL-3).

## 🔵 STANDING PENDING WORK (from the master queue — not new bugs)

- Entity contract suite (HANDOFF §4b, wf_87586bbf-b63) — RESUME; it owns B-SUMMON-1.
- Map contract suite (task #30, wf_8da16855-efe) — RESUME; add B-TEMPLE-DOOR + B-PORTAL contracts.
- Occult/Hunting mastery UI recheck (#35) — Will re-verifies selection screen; audit says trees clean.
- Souls quality pass vs SV originals (#31).
- Toxeus encounter suite: 10-25% canonical entrance spawn, rant scroll (MP per-player), Legendary
  stalker feasibility, 6-player checklist (#32).
- Comprehensive dropped-visuals restoration (#28).
- Cold Tombs (#36) — ON HOLD per Will.

## FIX-ROUND BATCHING NOTE
All the P0/P1 map items (B-PORTAL-1/2/3, B-SPRITE-1, B-SMOKE-1, B-TEMPLE-DOOR-1) share the map
lane → batch into one implement→vet wave, rebuild BOTH artifacts (canonical + TESTHUB), coupled
deploy. The DB items (B-SUMMON-1, B-TOXEUS-1) share apply_svc_patches → one DB wave. Portals
touch BOTH lanes (record fields = DB; placement = map) — coordinate.

## ✅ RESOLVED: deploy / packaging

### B-WORKSHOP-PKG-1: Workshop item shipped as two broken mods "database" + "resources" (FIXED 2026-07-08)
- **Symptom:** subscribers to item 3759792705 saw TWO broken mods "database" and "resources"
  instead of one "SoulvizierClassic". Root cause: package_workshop.ps1 staged database/ and
  resources/ as direct children of the vdf contentfolder, and SteamCMD uploads the contentfolder's
  CONTENTS, so the item root had no SoulvizierClassic wrapper (TQAE treats each top-level folder of a
  workshop item as a mod name).
- **Fix:** package_workshop.ps1 now stages to dist/workshop/content/SoulvizierClassic/{database,
  resources} and upload_workshop.ps1 points the vdf contentfolder at dist/workshop/content (whose
  only child is SoulvizierClassic). The packager wipes the stale wrapperless staging each run,
  asserts the content root has exactly one child, adds a permanent fail-loud TESTHUB guard (aborts if
  the packaged Levels.arc MD5 equals local/Levels_merged_TESTHUB.arc), and prints the packaged
  Levels.arc size + MD5. Verified: canonical map A1BA5DB2F00FFA067A808753A2E1EAC5 (688,691,849 B)
  matches the published copy; 53-file package; item root = a single SoulvizierClassic folder. Not yet
  re-uploaded (the next Workshop update push replaces the live broken item). Scripts:
  scripts/package_workshop.ps1, scripts/upload_workshop.ps1.
